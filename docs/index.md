# Version 1.0
This index.md file will reside in a **/docs directory** in a product's **master repository**. 
## 

This file can either be version specific or be added to with each new version's notes atop the previous one's.

It can include links ([some version related site or doc](http://mlphome.mlp.com/)), or just note that there's a website with all the details and full documentation availability and provide a link to the (jekyll-generated) overall MLP or product-specific website, e.g. [StarkDocs_Sample1](https://joecgithub.github.io/StarkDocs_Sample1/).
